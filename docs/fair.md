# Be FAIR!

Sustainable and reproducible research should be **FAIR**

**F**indable:
 * Metadata and data are assigned unique, persistent identifiers
 * Data as described with metadata
 * Metadata and data are registered with a searchable resource
 * Metadata specifies the data identifier

**A**ccessible
 * Metadata and data are retrievable by a standardised protocol
 * The protocol is open, free and universally open
 * It allows authentication and authorization if necessary
 * Metadata is accessible, even if the data disappears

**I**nteroperable
 * Metadata and data use a formal, accessible and shared language
 * Metadata and data use vocabularies that are FAIR
 * Metadata and data include references to other metadata and data

**R**e-usable
 * Metadata and data have accurate and relevant attributes
 * Metadata and data are released with a clear and accesible data license
 * Metadata and data are associated with their provenance
 * Metadata and data meet domain community standards
