# Enable Citation

Allow others to cite your software!

Add a citation file to your code to show how you want to be cited.

Provide a Digital Object Identifier for your code and data. 
	Figshare and Zenodo offer ways of doing this. 

If a paper uses your software, or part if it, without credit, contact the editor
