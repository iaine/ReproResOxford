# Cite your software sources

Describe software that provides a critical part of, or unique contribution to, your research
There are many ways of describing software: footnotes, acknowledgements, references, and method sections
Be aware that the software licence may require you attribute the software
Cite software papers as an aid not a replacement to software or data
In first drafts, always put in software references or bibliography
Be prepared to argue about including the software or the data
If the reviewer disagrees with the citation, add it to references
Recommended citations may need extra detail
If the software has a DOI, use it.
